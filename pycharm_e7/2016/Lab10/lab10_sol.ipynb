    "In the field of biomechanics, data interpolation is often used to define anatomical joint angles\n",

    "\n",
    "For clarity, illustrations defining hip angle (Figure 2) as well as the gait cycle (Figure 3) are\n",
    "provided. As shown in Figure 3, the gait cycle goes from 0 to 100% for each foot and is\n",
    "periodic in nature. For a given leg, an entire period of the gait cycle begins with the heel\n",
    "striking the \n",
    "oor and ends when the same heel strikes the \n",
    "oor again. Additionally, when\n",
    "the thigh and torso are completely vertical (i.e. standing perfectly vertical), the hip angle\n",
    "is zero degrees. Assuming a perfectly vertical torso, moving the thigh forward signifies hip flexion (positive angle) whereas moving the thigh backward signifies hip extension (negative angle)."
