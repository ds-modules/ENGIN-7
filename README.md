##  Engineering 7 in Python Notebooks

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/ds-modules/engineering)

This project is an attempt to convert the assignments of the Berkeley Engineering 7 course, which is currently taught in MATLAB, into a series of Jupyter Notebooks. Engineering 7 is a freshman-level introduction to programming for scientists and engineering students.

Our goal is to revamp the course to be fully python based, so that new students will have a more interactive and intutive experience. With Jupyter notebooks, students do not need to worry about the scaffolding of creating seperate files for every function, and can read and solve problems directly in one place. Instead, they can focus on learning the fundamentals of programming and writing the actual code itself, all managed in one place. Python and Jupyter Notebooks are also open-source and free to use, and also more extendable to future computer science and coding projects compared to MATLAB. For data science purposes, Jupyter notebooks are incredibly convient, as they support rendering of visuals directly in the notebook, which can be updated along with code.


## Structure

The repo is split between the 2016 and 2017 ENGIN-7 assignments, and currently we are focused on finishing the 2016 version. The raw python code is created in PyCharm, so the folders is structued for that IDE. Each lab will contain the MATLAB problems in PDF, some MATLAB helper files, a .py file with raw python solutions, and a .ipynb file that will be the completed notebook.


## Current Progress

		- [ ] Lab 4-12
	- [ ] Translating the MATLAB PDF assignments into markdown and LaTeX in the Jupyter notebook
	- [ ] Creating soluton notebooks with finished python code
	- [ ] Writing autograders for each notebook with Python `unittest`s
	- [ ] Polishing the notebooks
